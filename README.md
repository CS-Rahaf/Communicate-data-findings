## Ford Gobike Data Exploration


<br>


### Dataset

> In this document I will explore Ford gobike dataset.
This data set includes information about individual rides made in a bike-sharing system covering the greater San Francisco Bay area.
<br> Ford gobike dataset contains 183412 rows and 16 columns. After I loaded it in the pandas dataframe I used some Python libraries to wrangle it and do some cleaning.
<br>

### Summary of Findings
>  Depending on the results, we can say that the number of users depends on the age group, as the ages between 20 and 40 years were the most in the number of users and the number increases as we approach the 30 years. The number of users also depends on the timing, as the morning period sees more numbers than in the evening
<br>

### Key Insights for Presentation
> From the dataset I can noticed that the number of male users is more than twice as high as females. Whereas female are the ones who take the longest trips.<br>
On weekdays, average trip durations are longer than on weekends. And at 8:00, 16:00 and 17:00 the number of users is greater.
