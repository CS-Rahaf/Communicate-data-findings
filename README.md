## Ford Gobike Data Exploration



### Dataset

> In this document I will explore Ford gobike dataset.
This data set includes information about individual rides made in a bike-sharing system covering the greater San Francisco Bay area.
<br> Ford gobike dataset contains 183412 rows and 16 columns. After I loaded it in the pandas dataframe I used some Python libraries to wrangle it and do some cleaning.

### Summary of Findings
> From the dataset I can noticed that the number of male users is more than twice as high as females. Whereas female are the ones who take the longest trips.<br>
On weekdays, average trip durations are longer than on weekends. And at 8:00, 16:00 and 17:00 the number of users is greater.
